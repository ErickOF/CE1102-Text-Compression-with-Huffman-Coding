Turning the page write to cease new ideas
Thoughts all duly recorded
Maybe someday all the rhymes given time
Would get justly rewarded
So long ago you dont even know how it started
So there you go
Stashing the sketches and drafts of what has become an
Encyclopedia of all the things youve done
Expect the media to bother when youre gone
Hours and hours of sacrifice no compromise
